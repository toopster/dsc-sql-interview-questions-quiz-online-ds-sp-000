    "# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "TEXT, INTEGER, REAL, BLOB.  Strictly speaking, you can't use other common datatypes from other kinds of SQL but it is possible, for example, to use BOOLEAN but SQLite3 will use the INTEGER datatype for the storage class.  Similarly DATE and TIME could be stored as either TEXT, INTEGER or REAL datatypes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Keys are keys that exist are available in an different database table from the table where the key is a Primary Key.  It creates a relationship between the two tables. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "**One-to-one (1:1)**\n",
    "One record in the primary (key) table relates to a single matching record in the foreign (key) table\n",
    "\n",
    "**One-to-many (1:N)**\n",
    "One record in the primary (key) table relates to one or more matching records in the foreign (key) table\n",
    "\n",
    "**Many-to-many (N:M)**\n",
    "One or more records in the primary (key) table relate to one or more matching records in the foreign (key) table\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "**INNER JOIN:** Returns records that have matching values in both tables\n",
    "\n",
    "**LEFT JOIN:** Returns all records from the left / primary table, and the matched records from the right / foreign table\n",
    "\n",
    "**RIGHT JOIN:** Returns all records from the right / foreign table, and the matched records from the left / primary table\n",
    "\n",
    "**FULL OUTER JOIN**: Returns all records when there is a match in either left / primary or right / foreign table\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregate functions are typically used in conjunction with a GROUP BY statement.  The GROUP BY statement produces a summary record for a field with the Aggregate function defining the basis on which that summary is produced, e.g. SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "An 'Associative Entity' is a mapping table, that creates relationships between two other database tables by solely referencing the primary keys of each table. In effect, it contains a number of foreign keys, each in a many-to-one relationship from the mapping table (associative entity) to the individual data tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
